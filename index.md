## Introduction

Welcome to the **Wearable Step Counter** project. This project focuses on creating a simple, responsive technology that counts steps using an accelerometer and displays the total on a small wearable device.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and develop a basic wearable that:
- Counts the number of steps taken by the user.
- Displays the step count on a small screen attached to the wearable.

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Nano
- **Accelerometer**: ADXL345
- **Display**: OLED Screen
- **Power Source**: Battery
- **Wearable Strap**: Velcro or 3D-printed case

## Process Documentation

The following sections document the step-by-step process of building this project, including component selection, coding, assembly, and testing.

## Final Thoughts

This simple wearable step counter demonstrates the core principles of responsive technology in a manageable and educational project.
