## Week 1: Project Concept & Research
- **Goal**: The primary goal this week was to establish a clear concept for a context-aware mobile web app and explore existing technologies and applications that use mobile device sensors. The focus was on leveraging geolocation and orientation sensors to provide a personalized and dynamic user experience that adapts to the user's physical environment.
- **Concept**: The app I intend to develop will respond to the user's physical environment by tapping into the following device sensors:

Geolocation (GPS) – to track the user’s position and adapt the app's content based on their location.
Device Orientation (Gyroscope/Accelerometer) – to track how the user is holding and moving their device, altering the app’s behavior accordingly.

Example Use Cases:
Location-based interaction: The app could display relevant points of interest (e.g., nearby landmarks, cafes, or events) based on the user’s GPS coordinates.
Orientation-based interaction: Depending on the direction the user faces, the app could change the UI or provide context-relevant data, such as showing information about landmarks in the user’s field of view.

Visual Conceptualization:
I created a simple visual representation of the app's key components, illustrating how it might work based on sensor input. Below is a conceptual diagram outlining how the geolocation and orientation sensors feed into the app’s interface:

- **Inspiration**: Research and Inspiration
Research Goal:
Before beginning development, I researched existing apps and projects that effectively use geolocation and device orientation sensors. These applications helped inform the technical feasibility and design decisions for my app.

Key Inspirations:
Google Maps: A prime example of geolocation integration. The app continuously updates the user’s position, offering location-based services like navigation, traffic updates, and nearby places of interest.

Google Maps providing real-time location data.

Relevance: The way Google Maps integrates geolocation inspired me to focus on real-time location-based updates in my own app.

AR Navigation: Augmented reality (AR) apps, like Google ARCore or Pokemon Go, use the phone’s camera and orientation sensors to overlay digital content onto the real world. These apps offer immersive experiences by reacting to how the device is tilted or moved.

Augmented reality apps showcasing the power of orientation tracking.

Relevance: Orientation-based interactions in AR apps demonstrate how a device’s movement can enrich user experiences by dynamically adapting the app interface.

Star Walk 2: This app uses both geolocation and device orientation to map out the stars based on the user’s location and the direction they are pointing their device.

Relevance: Star Walk 2 combines geolocation and orientation seamlessly, serving as a strong model for integrating both types of sensors in my app.


- **Reflection**: Combining Geolocation & Orientation:
Location and orientation sensors provide a simple yet powerful way to create a dynamic user experience that responds to the real world. However, the challenge lies in combining both inputs in a way that is intuitive and user-friendly. For example:

Smooth transitions between different interface modes based on location changes.
Responsive and non-intrusive orientation-based actions that feel natural to the user.
Initial Thoughts:
Opportunities: By merging geolocation and orientation, the app can become a powerful tool for contextual interactions, potentially useful in fields like tourism, education, or navigation.
Challenges: The technical challenge will be balancing both sensors' data to provide a fluid experience. Sensor accuracy and permission handling will also be critical.
Next Steps:
Begin prototyping the geolocation feature, focusing on retrieving the user’s position in real-time.
Research more in-depth on sensor fusion techniques that can effectively combine orientation and location data for more complex interactions.
Create mockups to visualize how the interface changes with the different sensor inputs.

## Week 2: Geolocation Integration
- **Goal**: Implement geolocation to track the user’s location and provide real-time information.
- **Progress**: 
  - Used the browser's built-in `navigator.geolocation` API to fetch latitude and longitude.
  - Integrated **Google Maps API** to display the user’s current location on a map.
- **Challenges**: Handling cases where users deny location access and testing accuracy in different environments.
- **Code Snippet**:
```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
    let latitude = position.coords.latitude;
    let longitude = position.coords.longitude;
    console.log("Latitude: " + latitude + ", Longitude: " + longitude);
    // Display location on map
});
- **Reflection**: The geolocation feature was successfully implemented. Next, I plan to link this location data to real-time contextual information, such as nearby points of interest.

## Week 3: Orientation Integration
- **Goal**: Implement device orientation tracking using the gyroscope and accelerometer.
- **Progress**: 
  - Integrated the DeviceOrientation API to detect changes in device rotation.
  - Tested UI reactions to different device orientations.
- **Challenges**: Interpreting orientation data meaningfully (alpha, beta, gamma values) and providing a smooth user experience.
- **Code Snippet**:
window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', function(event) {
    let alpha = event.alpha;
    let beta = event.beta;
    let gamma = event.gamma;
    console.log(`Alpha: ${alpha}, Beta: ${beta}, Gamma: ${gamma}`);
});
- **Reflection**: This feature can create a fun and interactive experience, such as changing the information displayed based on the direction the user is facing.

## Week 4: Combining Location and Orientation
- **Goal**: Merge geolocation and orientation functionality to create a seamless user experience.
- **Progress**: 
  - Successfully combined location and orientation tracking.
  - Developed a feature where the app provides different information based on the user's location and device tilt.
  - Example: The app now shows nearby landmarks based on location and adjusts UI content based on the phone’s direction.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring that changes in orientation feel intuitive and not overwhelming, while handling location updates efficiently.
- **Reflection**: Combining these two sensors results in a richer, more immersive experience. Testing in different environments will be crucial for optimization.

---

## Week 5: Refinement
- **Goal**: Improve UI/UX and handle edge cases.
- **Progress**: 
  - Refined the app’s design to ensure smooth transitions between different contexts (location changes and orientation shifts).
  - Implemented error handling for cases where users deny sensor permissions or move to areas with poor GPS signal.
  - Conducted user testing to gather feedback.
- **Next Steps**: Prepare for the final project presentation, refine edge cases, and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
