## Project Overview
This project is a mobile web application that utilizes mobile device sensors (geolocation and device orientation) to create a responsive, context-aware user experience. The app changes its interface and functionality based on the user's location and the orientation of their mobile device.

## Week 1: Project Concept & Research
- **Goal**: Establish a concept for a context-aware app and research similar projects.
- **Concept**: The app will respond to the user's physical environment, using mobile device sensors such as location (via GPS) and orientation (via gyroscope/accelerometer).
- **Inspiration**: Explored apps such as Google Maps for geolocation and augmented reality apps for orientation tracking.
- **Reflection**: Location and orientation sensors offer a simple yet powerful way to create a dynamic, real-world-responsive user experience. The challenge will be combining both inputs meaningfully.

## Week 2: Geolocation Integration
- **Goal**: Implement geolocation to track the user’s location and provide real-time information.
- **Progress**: 
  - Used the browser's built-in `navigator.geolocation` API to fetch latitude and longitude.
  - Integrated **Google Maps API** to display the user’s current location on a map.
- **Challenges**: Handling cases where users deny location access and testing accuracy in different environments.
- **Code Snippet**:
```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
    let latitude = position.coords.latitude;
    let longitude = position.coords.longitude;
    console.log("Latitude: " + latitude + ", Longitude: " + longitude);
    // Display location on map
});
- **Reflection**: The geolocation feature was successfully implemented. Next, I plan to link this location data to real-time contextual information, such as nearby points of interest.

## Week 3: Orientation Integration
- **Goal**: Implement device orientation tracking using the gyroscope and accelerometer.
- **Progress**: 
  - Integrated the DeviceOrientation API to detect changes in device rotation.
  - Tested UI reactions to different device orientations.
- **Challenges**: Interpreting orientation data meaningfully (alpha, beta, gamma values) and providing a smooth user experience.
- **Code Snippet**:
window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', function(event) {
    let alpha = event.alpha;
    let beta = event.beta;
    let gamma = event.gamma;
    console.log(`Alpha: ${alpha}, Beta: ${beta}, Gamma: ${gamma}`);
});
- **Reflection**: This feature can create a fun and interactive experience, such as changing the information displayed based on the direction the user is facing.

## Week 4: Combining Location and Orientation
- **Goal**: Merge geolocation and orientation functionality to create a seamless user experience.
- **Progress**: 
  - Successfully combined location and orientation tracking.
  - Developed a feature where the app provides different information based on the user's location and device tilt.
  - Example: The app now shows nearby landmarks based on location and adjusts UI content based on the phone’s direction.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring that changes in orientation feel intuitive and not overwhelming, while handling location updates efficiently.
- **Reflection**: Combining these two sensors results in a richer, more immersive experience. Testing in different environments will be crucial for optimization.

## Week 5: Refinement
- **Goal**: Improve UI/UX and handle edge cases.
- **Progress**: 
  - Refined the app’s design to ensure smooth transitions between different contexts (location changes and orientation shifts).
  - Implemented error handling for cases where users deny sensor permissions or move to areas with poor GPS signal.
  - Conducted user testing to gather feedback.
- **Next Steps**: Prepare for the final project presentation, refine edge cases, and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
