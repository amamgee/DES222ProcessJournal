## Project Overview
This project is a mobile web application that utilizes mobile device sensors (geolocation and device orientation) to create a responsive, context-aware user experience. The app changes its interface and functionality based on the user's location and the orientation of their mobile device.

## Project Concept & Research

- **Goal**: 
  The primary goal this week was to establish a clear concept for a context-aware mobile web app and explore existing technologies that utilize mobile device sensors. The focus was on leveraging geolocation and orientation sensors to provide a personalized, dynamic user experience that adapts to the user's physical environment.

- **Concept**: 
  The app will respond to the user's physical environment by tapping into two key device sensors:
  - **Geolocation (GPS)**: Tracks the user’s position and adapts the app's content based on their location.
  - **Device Orientation (Gyroscope/Accelerometer)**: Tracks how the user is holding or moving their device, altering the app’s behavior accordingly.

### Example Use Cases:
- **Location-based interaction**: The app could display relevant points of interest (e.g., nearby landmarks, cafes, or events) based on the user’s GPS coordinates.
- **Orientation-based interaction**: Depending on the direction the user faces, the app could change the UI or provide context-relevant data, such as showing information about landmarks in the user’s field of view.

### Visual Conceptualisation:
A simple visual representation of the app's key components was created to illustrate how it might work based on sensor input. Below is a conceptual diagram outlining how the geolocation and orientation sensors feed into the app’s interface:

- **Inspiration**: 
  - **Research Goal**: Before starting development, I researched existing apps that effectively use geolocation and device orientation sensors. This research helped inform the technical feasibility and design decisions for the app.

  ### Key Inspirations:
  - **Google Maps**: A prime example of geolocation integration. Google Maps continuously updates the user’s position, offering location-based services like navigation, traffic updates, and nearby places of interest.  
    - **Relevance**: Inspired real-time location-based updates in my app.

  - **AR Navigation**: Apps like Google ARCore and Pokémon Go use the phone’s camera and orientation sensors to overlay digital content onto the real world, reacting to how the device is tilted or moved.  
    - **Relevance**: Showcased how orientation-based interactions can enrich the user experience by dynamically adapting the app interface.

  - **Star Walk 2**: This app uses both geolocation and orientation to map out stars based on the user's location and the direction they're pointing their device.  
    - **Relevance**: A strong example of seamlessly integrating geolocation and orientation, providing a model for sensor fusion in my app.

- **Reflection**: 
  Location and orientation sensors offer a simple yet powerful way to create a dynamic, real-world-responsive user experience. However, combining both inputs meaningfully and intuitively presents challenges, such as:
  - Smooth transitions between different interface modes based on location.
  - Responsive, non-intrusive orientation-based actions that feel natural to the user.

### Initial Thoughts:
- **Opportunities**: By merging geolocation and orientation, the app can become a powerful tool for contextual interactions, with potential applications in tourism, education, or navigation.
- **Challenges**: Balancing data from both sensors to provide a fluid experience, handling sensor accuracy, and managing user permissions will be crucial.

### Next Steps:
- Begin prototyping the geolocation feature, focusing on retrieving the user’s position in real time.
- Research sensor fusion techniques to combine orientation and location data for complex interactions.
- Create mockups to visualise how the interface changes with different sensor inputs.

## Geolocation Integration
- **Goal**: Implement geolocation to track the user’s location and provide real-time information.
- **Progress**: 
  - Used the browser's built-in `navigator.geolocation` API to fetch latitude and longitude.
  - Integrated **Google Maps API** to display the user’s current location on a map.
- **Challenges**: Handling cases where users deny location access and testing accuracy in different environments.
- **Code Snippet**:
```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
    let latitude = position.coords.latitude;
    let longitude = position.coords.longitude;
    console.log("Latitude: " + latitude + ", Longitude: " + longitude);
    // Display location on map
});
- **Reflection**: The geolocation feature was successfully implemented. Next, I plan to link this location data to real-time contextual information, such as nearby points of interest.

## Orientation Integration
- **Goal**: Implement device orientation tracking using the gyroscope and accelerometer.
- **Progress**: 
  - Integrated the DeviceOrientation API to detect changes in device rotation.
  - Tested UI reactions to different device orientations.
- **Challenges**: Interpreting orientation data meaningfully (alpha, beta, gamma values) and providing a smooth user experience.
- **Code Snippet**:
window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', function(event) {
    let alpha = event.alpha;
    let beta = event.beta;
    let gamma = event.gamma;
    console.log(`Alpha: ${alpha}, Beta: ${beta}, Gamma: ${gamma}`);
});
- **Reflection**: This feature can create a fun and interactive experience, such as changing the information displayed based on the direction the user is facing.

## Combining Location and Orientation
- **Goal**: Merge geolocation and orientation functionality to create a seamless user experience.
- **Progress**: 
  - Successfully combined location and orientation tracking.
  - Developed a feature where the app provides different information based on the user's location and device tilt.
  - Example: The app now shows nearby landmarks based on location and adjusts UI content based on the phone’s direction.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring that changes in orientation feel intuitive and not overwhelming, while handling location updates efficiently.
- **Reflection**: Combining these two sensors results in a richer, more immersive experience. Testing in different environments will be crucial for optimization.

---

## Refinement
- **Goal**: Improve UI/UX and handle edge cases.
- **Progress**: 
  - Refined the app’s design to ensure smooth transitions between different contexts (location changes and orientation shifts).
  - Implemented error handling for cases where users deny sensor permissions or move to areas with poor GPS signal.
  - Conducted user testing to gather feedback.
- **Next Steps**: Prepare for the final project presentation, refine edge cases, and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
